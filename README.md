# ETH-Proof-Beginner
This repository is made as the submission of the course ETH-Proof Beginner offered by Metacrafters. This course provided me the insights of the basics of Etheriumn blockchain as well as Solidity language. The basics of Solidity like variables, structs, mapping, functions, conditional statements were all taught in this course. Also it is used in this project!

## Description
The project of this course was to write a smart contract in the solidity, to create a new token. I have named it "YASH" and it's abbreviation is "YSH". Also there are two functions, first being the mint function where if someone mints my tokens, his wallet balance will get updated as well as the total supply of my token. The second function is Burn function, where if someone burns the YSH tokens, it will first check if that person has that much balance or not and then burn accordingly and update the balances.

## Getting Started
I used different concepts of solidity language to write this smart contract like struct, mapping, functions, etc. And I learned this from the course provided by Metacrafters.

### Installing
* You can test this code by copy-pasting it on the Remix Online IDE for solidity.
* There you can compile and deploy the code online only without any need to set up local environment.

### Executing program
* In Remix IDE, compile the smart contract by pressing CTRL+S or from the left menu.
* When compiled we can deploy the code from the menu itself.
* After deploying we have to enter the required values, and we can check the outputs there only.
